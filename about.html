    <h1>Soma Majumder</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        I am currently exploring careers in the technology and IT field while also continuing my education as a Full Stack software engineer with the Pursuit Fellowship, which is an intensive 12-month Fellowship that trains future software engineers and developers. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Much of my experiences have equipped me with the skills to be an effective team player, problem solver, and action orientated collaborator and leader. After completing the Per Scholas IT Support Training Program, I have a Google IT Support Professional Certificate and technical skills like troubleshooting, networking, operating systems, system administration, security, and hands-on assessments. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When my experiences as a creative are compiled with growing technical mastery, I am more than equipped to problem solve and build like an engineer! With the help of the Pursuit Fellowship, I am excited to explore all of the different career opportunities that encompass both my skills and my passions.
        <br>

        You can find out more about me on Linked and the projects I have worked on my Github!

      <h2>Hardest Bug So Far</h2>
      <p>
        My hardest bug I ever came across was this infinite loop I couldn't
        escape.
      </p>
      <p>I came up with a totally sick solution by asking my coding mentors about it and killing the terminal</p>
